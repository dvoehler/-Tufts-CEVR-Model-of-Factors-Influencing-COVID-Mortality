Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacted a significant toll on population health over the past 15 months. Globally, nearly 186 million cases have been confirmed, and over 4 million individuals have died.(1) The pandemic’s impact has been particularly acute in the United States, where nearly 20% of worldwide confirmed cases have been diagnosed and 1 of every 6 recorded fatalities has occurred.(1)

Multiple risk factors have been found to be associated with COVID-19 mortality, among them advanced age, male gender, and comorbidities that are common in American adults, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.(2) In the past several decades, multiple strides have been made in the diagnosis, management, and control of these comorbidities. These advances beg a natural question: while the pandemic’s toll has been significant, how much worse might it have been had the pandemic occurred when the burden of these comorbidities was greater?

To address this question, we developed a straightforward model, based on publicly-available US population and epidemiologic statistics, to assess the impact of reduced prevalence and/or better control of key comorbidities on the rate of COVID-19 deaths among older individuals hospitalized with the disease. We hypothesize that improvements in pharmaceutical and other management of comorbidities known to be risk factors for mortality among those hospitalized for COVID-19 have made the impact of this pandemic less devastating than if it had occurred at an earlier time.

Methods

This analysis quantifies the benefits resulting from better control of diabetes and hypertension, as well as from reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in older Americans hospitalized for COVID-19. Our assessment estimated the hypothetical number of added COVID-19 deaths due to these comorbidities that would have occurred had the pandemic occurred in 1990 rather than the present time. We attribute the difference between the estimated mortality for 1990 and the current period to improvements in pharmaceutical and other measures to manage comorbidities.

We focused on older adults (age 65 and older) hospitalized for COVID-19, as these individuals are at the highest risk of COVID-19 mortality. We first adjusted population-based hospitalization rates for COVID-19 were to reflect increased mortality risk separately for those age 65-74 and 75 and older, as well as for male vs. female sex.(2) We then estimated the effect of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease based on odds ratios for these conditions reported in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis.(2)

Next, we assumed that better management has: (a) reduced comorbidity prevalence between 1990 and the present; (b) improved control of diabetes and hypertension (defined as having blood glucose and blood pressure within their respective target ranges) because of pharmaceutical and other management measures; or (c) both. Our base case analyses assumed that better comorbidity control was associated with a 33% reduction in the comorbidity-specific odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality, based on data from population-based cohort study of over 17 million individuals.(3) We explored the impact of this assumption on our results in sensitivity analyses (20-80% reduction in the odds ratio). We note that greater reductions in risk in this range will make some odds ratios protective (i.e., less than 1.0), a phenomenon that was observed with some comorbidities in the same cohort study.(3)

Our base case analysis applied specific estimates to each period, including:

• Population distribution by sex within age strata (65-74, 75+)

• Prevalence of each comorbidity; and,

• Where relevant, the proportion of individuals with each comorbidity for whom that comorbidity is well controlled.

We obtained population statistics for both 1990 (4) and the current period (5) from U.S. Census Bureau data. We obtained the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in each period from multiple reports of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).(6-8) For diabetes and hypertension, we obtained data on the proportion of patients with “well-controlled” disease from multiple sources, including NHANES and a cross-sectional study of risk factor control in approximately 5,000 community-based individuals.(9-11)

Key Assumptions

Our base case analysis made the following key assumptions:

• The population-based rate of COVID-19 hospitalization was the same (0.014)(12) across age-, sex-, and comorbidity-based strata

• The risk of in-hospital mortality among those hospitalized for COVID-19 was elevated for males and those age 75 or older

• For those with key comorbidities, age and sex do not influence the increased risk of mortality (i.e., the same odds ratio is applied across all age and sex strata)

• We considered the impact of each comorbidity on mortality separately. That is, we did not consider the possibility that risks for individuals with multiple comorbidities should be added or multiplied

• Estimates reflected the early phase of the pandemic (spring 2020)

Key Estimates

The base mortality risk for hospitalized patients was 8%, a value we increased by a factor of 1.8 (to 14.4%) for advanced age and by a factor of 1.72 (to 13.8%) for males. The prevalence of diabetes was age- and period-specific, and ranged from 8-19% in both time periods. CVD prevalence declined from historical rates of 26-34% across age strata to 18-25% currently. Hypertension prevalence was age-adjusted and remained relatively stable across time periods. The proportion of those with diabetes who are well-controlled increased from 39.7% in 1990 to 72.0% currently, while estimates for well-controlled hypertension were 31.6% and 48.4% respectively.

Sensitivity Analyses

We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the potential influence of uncertainty on our results. First, because population growth can obscure the benefits of reduced comorbidity prevalence and/or improved control, we developed a scenario that holds population constant at current levels while assuming the improvements in comorbidity prevalence and/or control rates from our base case analysis. Second, given the uncertainty in the level of risk reduction associated with better comorbidity control, we varied these reductions from 20-80%. Finally, because there are other high-income settings in which hypertension prevalence has declined significantly, we developed a scenario that assumed an absolute decline in hypertension prevalence between 1990 and the present consistent with that observed in Sweden (~13%).(13) We assessed the impact of these alternative assumptions both individually and collectively.

Results

In the base case diabetes analysis, approximately 8,600 deaths would be expected historically in a population of 2.9 million diabetics, corresponding to a death rate of 0.3%. During the current period, the deaths would rise to approximately 26,000 in a population of 9.4 million diabetics, corresponding to a death rate of 0.275% (an 8% reduction). For hypertension, the deaths would grow from approximately 51,000 to 74,000, but the death rate would decline from 0.35% to 0.33%. Finally, while the prevalence of CVD has declined substantially over time, population growth outweighed the impact of this reduction, leading to a slight increase in expected deaths and the population death rate (there is no control proportion for CVD).

In contrast to the base case, which showed increases in deaths even when we incorporated the Swedish drop in hypertension prevalence, the sensitivity analysis showed substantial reductions in deaths for all comorbidities, ranging from 6% (hypertension, US prevalence) to 30% (hypertension, Swedish prevalence) when we held the underlying population constant at current levels. When we increased risk reduction from comorbidity to 80% and held population constant, deaths from diabetes decreased by 38% and by 39% for hypertension (Swedish prevalence).

Limitations

As noted above, we evaluated the impact of altering comorbidity prevalence assumptions and control rate assumptions individually, although it is likely that altering these assumptions simultaneously would have produced more substantial changes. Reductions in mortality from better comorbidity control were somewhat speculative, although we note there is some recent literature support for these assumptions. Finally, our analysis cannot account for all changes in population health or health systems over time.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the COVID-19 death rate among hospitalized individuals with selected comorbidities is lower than it would have been in the past. While the number of deaths is greater than it would have been in the past because the population has grown, our analysis suggests that the death rate is lower than it would have been in earlier times. Based on our findings, improvements in management of these comorbidities has forestalled an even greater toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.
